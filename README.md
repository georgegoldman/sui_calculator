# On-Chain Calculator using Move (Sui Network)

This is a simple on-chain calculator built with the Move programming language on the Sui blockchain. It was created as a learning project to explore Move and the Sui network's features.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Demonstrates how to write and deploy smart contracts using Move.

## Purpose

This project is purely for practice and learning. It helped me understand:

- Writing smart contracts in Move.
- Deploying and interacting with contracts on the Sui network.

## Getting Started

- Install the Move CLI and Sui CLI.
- Deploy the contract to a Sui testnet or local network.

## Notes

Feel free to explore or modify the code as part of your own learning journey!
